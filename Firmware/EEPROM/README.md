# How to re-program the PiJuice EEPROM

From the [EEPROM datasheet](https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/blob/master/Hardware/Datasheets/CAT24C32-D.PDF) you will see that the EEPROM has a write protect pin:

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to manage the programming of the EEPROM should you need to change or fix the contents, so we have made it so you can manage the write protect pin from the GUI or CLI interface. Basically, you need to remove the write protect on the EEPROM, so you can then flash it with the Raspberry Pi EEPROM tools. For that you can go to the [HAT config menu](https://github.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/blob/master/Software/README.md#pijuice-hat-general-config-menu), and tick the "ID EEPROM Write unprotect" box:

Then you can use the [Raspberry Pi EEPROM utils](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/tree/master/eepromutils) to program the EEPROM. You can also find a guide [here from the Raspberry Pi forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=108134).

You can use these commands:
```
# Clone Raspberry Pi HATs repo:
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats.git

# Install the device tree compiler.
sudo apt install device-tree-compiler

# Enter eepromutils directory
cd hats/eepromutils

# Create the tools
make && sudo make install

# Create a blank eeprom file
dd if=/dev/zero ibs=1k count=4 of=blank.eep

# Compile the device tree fragment
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/master/Firmware/EEPROM/pijuice.dts
sudo dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o pijuice.dtb pijuice.dts ; sudo chown pi:pi pijuice.dtb

# Get the settings file and make the .eep file
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PiSupply/PiJuice/master/Firmware/EEPROM/settings.txt
# Make sure to edit the settings.txt file with your actual device UUID
cat /proc/device-tree/hat/uuid
nano settings.txt

eepmake settings.txt pijuice.eep pijuice.dtb

# Blank the EEPROM and then flash it
sudo eepflash.sh -w -f=blank.eep -t=24c32
sudo eepflash.sh -w -f=pijuice.eep -t=24c32
```
