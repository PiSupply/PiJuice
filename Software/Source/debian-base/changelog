pijuice-base (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Firmware V1.4_2020_01_17
    - Reworked I2C code, so using i2c-bcm2708 is not neeed any more for Pi 4.
    - Fixed fluctuating temperature readings.
    - Changed order of battery profiles. PjZero 1000mAh is now profile 0
      (= default on PiJuice-Zero)
    - Delayed power off will be cancelled if RPi 5V power is restored before
      the timer runs out (Issue #356).
    - Fixed missing clearing wake-up flags for the GPIO3 wakeup case.

  * pijuice.py
    - Battery profiles order changed in 1.4 firmware.
    - Also accept True or False as first argument of pj.config.SetChargingConfig.
    - Work-around for some 'DATA_CORRUPTION' cases when retrieving data from
      the PiJuice.

  * pijuice_cli.py
    - Support changed battery profiles order in the 1.4 firmware.
    - Wakeup-on-charge allow lower bound of 0 instead of 1.
    - Show firmware path on the firmware tab (as in the gui).
    - Check for valid 7-bit I2C addresses.
    - Bug fixes.

pijuice-base (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support for new features in firmware 1.3
    - Alternative method for measuring the charge of the battery by the MCU directly
      in case the fuel gauge IC is not available or is faulty.
    - Extended battery profile with parameters for the alternative method
    - Added option to force use of the alternative method.
    - More predefined battery profiles: BP6X_1400, BP7X_1820, SNN5843_2300,
      PJLIPO_12000, PJLIPO_5000, PJBP7X_1600, PJSNN5843_1300, PJZERO_1200,
      PJZERO_1000, PJLIPO_600, PJLIPO_500.
    - Use IO2 digital input as source for wakeup enabling peripheral attached to
      the P3 header to wake-up Raspberry Pi.
    - Added alternative wakeup via RPi GPIO3 (used as I2C SCL after boot) if run pin
      is not connected (no pogo pin) and PiJuice powered via RPi.

  * pijuice.py
    - Added support for commands for the firmware 1.3 features 

  * pijuice_cli.py
    - Works with both 1.2 qnd 1.3 firmware. 1.3 firmware features only shown when
      1.3 firmware is present.
    - Better feedback during firmware update.

pijuice-base (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * General
    - Install only for python3.
    - Added non priviliged user pijuice
    - The pijuice service (pijuice_sys.py), pijuice_gui and pijuice_cli now
      execute with effective user pijuice.
    - User scripts canot be executed as root.

  * pijuice.py
    - Setting PWM parameters for IO1 and IO2 now works.

  * pijuice_sys.py
    - User scrips have to be executable and the script owner must belong to
      the pijuice group. Scripts owned by root will not be executed.
    - Button configuration changes in the gui/cli are now also changed in the service.
    - Changes in settings for system task (min_charge, min_bat_voltage) and
      system events (low_charge, low_battery_voltage, no_power) are changed in
      the service when the service is running. 
    - Added support for 'Software Halt Power Off' feature.
    - Watchdog changes in the GUI/CLI now change immediately in PiJuice.

  * pijuice_cli.py
    - Added 'System Task', 'System Events' and 'User Script' tabs.
      Now pijuice_cli matches pijuice_gui.
    - Execute with effective user pijuice (non privileged) using the pijuice_cli command.
    - 'Status' tab updates every second (as in the gui).
    - I2C addresses can be changed.
    - 'Wakeup Alarm' tab: The UTC time now updates every second.

pijuice-base (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * pijuice.py:
    - Function for getting versions (OS, Firmware, Software)

  * src/pijuice_sys.py:
    - Refactored GetFirmvareVersion to GetFirmwareVersion #34

  * data/firmware/PiJuice-V1.1_2018_01_15.elf.binary:
    - Wakeup on charge updated to be activated only if power source is present.
    - Further this enables wakeup after plugged if this parameter is set to 0.
    - Button wakeup functions power off and power off can now be assigned to arbitrary button events. Removed constrain to be assigned only to long_press2 for power off, and single_press for power on.
    - Added reset function that can be assigned to some of buttons and button events.
    - Added no battery turn on configuration.
    - Now it can be set whether or not user wants to turn on 5V rail as soon as power input is connected and there is no battery.
    - Added configuration for 2 IO ports. They can be set to analog input, digital input, digital output and pwm output.
